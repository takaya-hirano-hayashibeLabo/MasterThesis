He graduated from Wahirohigashi Elementary School in Fukuoka City, Wahirokaoka Junior High School in Fukuoka City, and Fukuoka Institute of Technology High School (now Joto High School attached to Fukuoka Institute of Technology).He had a muscular physique since his school days, but was more passionate about basketball than bodybuilding at that time.
He started muscle training at LBGYM in Kashii during his high school years.After becoming a TV personality, he visited LBGYM in 2005 and 2020 for a commercial TV program in Fukuoka.The program was aired on RKB Mainichi Broadcasting and TNC TV Nishinihon.
One of her classmates in high school was Motoei Kusakabe, a female judoist and bronze medalist at the Sydney Olympics.After graduating from high school, she entered Yoshimoto Sogo Gakuin (NSC) Osaka School as a 22nd year student [2][5].Before entering NSC, he appeared on the October 30, 1998 broadcast of Asahi Broadcasting Corporation's "Tantei!Night Scoop" on October 30, 1998 [Note 1] [Note 2].His classmates at NSC include Super Maradona, Kazunobu Kubota (Torosomon), and King Kong.After graduating from NSC in 2000, he debuted with Yoshimoto Kogyo as "Nakayamakini-kun," a pin comedian who performs gags using muscles[2].His godfather was Takayuki Haranishi (FUJIWARA), who was also his senior at NSC, but the name he initially invented was simply "Kinnikun" without "Nakayama." In 2001, he joined Yoshimoto Shinki Gekijou, where he played a clerk and a henchman of a yakuza gang.After completing a series of material in which he talks while using his muscular body to show off his muscles, he reports to his older brother (or employer, etc.), "I did all I had to do!I've done all I can do!"[Note 3] In January 2003, he won the judges' special award at the 24th ABC Comedy Newcomer Grand Prix.In 2006, he invented a new character, "Captain Bomber," who was supposed to be "a man from North Carolina who came to Japan to introduce American culture," and made it to the finals of the R-1 Grand Prix that same year.On this occasion, he placed a portrait of Nakayamakin on stage and performed his material as a different person from Kinnikun (even though he denied being called Kinnikun) [Note 4].When asked by his co-star Shinya Ueda (Kurimuchu) about his appearance on Asahi Broadcasting Corporation TV's "Gold Medal of Laughter" under the name Captainâ˜†Bomber, he stubbornly denied that he was Nakayamakini-kun.In the Shinkigeki theater to which he belongs, he has been pushing "Captain Bomber" to the forefront and has started an event "Shinkigeki Bomber!He was also appointed as the image character of "Puururando RiO" at Misaki Park in Misaki Town, Sennan County, Osaka Prefecture, and his name recognition was greatly enhanced.Around the same time, he used his physical training to participate in the then-popular TBS "Who's the Strongest Man?The Fierce Muscle Battle!He has appeared in sports specials such as "The Sportsman No. 1 Championship" and has achieved a number of good results (see below).
